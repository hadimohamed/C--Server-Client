# CSharp-Server-Client
- server and client code by c# language simple code for connection type reverse_connection thats meaning client will look for server and that does not require two confirm connection from two sides because server already is ready for reverse_connextion and listenning on specific port waiting someone to connect to him 
- you can deploy client on any other language like Python and so on the server , i tried it by making server python language and run it on linux waiting for connection from client in c# runnung on windows operating system
